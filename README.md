XML editor specifically for LSR configs. It automatically detects all XML files, loads them, and turns them into readable lists of categories and entries, so you don’t have to scroll and search through massive XML blocks manually.

You can browse by entry type (vehicles, drugs, gangs, dealers, UI, gameplay settings, etc.), select entries, and edit any value directly, prices, duration's, effects, spawn chances, strings, locations, and more.

The editor also performs automated backups, every time you save changes, it creates a timestamped XML backup so you never lose work or overwrite something accidentally.

It includes a built in keyword search. You can search for anything ("cocaine", "mp5", "Underground", etc.) and it scans all XML files, then shows the following.

- which XML files contain that keyword
- which entry types match
- which specific entries contain it
- which field(s) inside those entries matched

You can jump straight into the exact entry from search, and the editor highlights the matching entry and the exact field that triggered the match. From there, you can edit values.

You can also duplicate entries, pick an existing one, clone it, modify values, and the new version is added automatically under that category. Alternatively, you can simply view entries without changing anything, or edit existing ones directly.
